# Time-series-anomaly-detection

The OpenTelemetry demo is deployed using Docker to simulate a real-time environment where various types of telemetry data, including metrics, traces, and logs, are generated. This data is then directed through a pipeline that has been reconfigured to send the collected information to a ClickHouse database for efficient storage and querying. Locust is employed as a load generator to simulate user traffic on the website, creating a controlled yet dynamic environment where performance and anomaly detection can be rigorously tested.

To detect anomalies, feature flags within the system are strategically toggled to cause specific services to stop functioning. This intentional disruption allows for the generation of distinctive patterns in the telemetry data, which are then analyzed to understand the impact of the anomalies. A custom Python script is used to systematically inject these anomalies, providing a controlled means of testing the systemâ€™s response and the accuracy of the anomaly detection methods.

Various anomaly detection models are evaluated to determine their effectiveness. The models tested include Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Isolation Forest, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and LSTM-wavelet transform. Each model is assessed for its ability to detect anomalies based on the patterns generated by the feature flag disruptions. The performance of these models is compared to identify the most effective approach for real-world anomaly detection in the telemetry data.
